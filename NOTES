============================

This Git repo contains the full history of my public domain strftime and
date package.  Using some simple scripts I converted the files from RCS
to Git and was able to preserve the history of the dates when the files
were checked in.

And, due to the wonders of the Google and the Internet, I was able to find
when different versions of the package had been posted to USENET in order
to tag different versions with their corresponding release information.

As a brief history, the first two versions were posted in
comp.sources.misc.  Later I posted versions in comp.sources.unix. There
was a disconnect in the numbering, such that releases 4.0 and 5.0 never
existed.

The last posted version was Release 7.0, made available for download
from ftp://freefriends.org as Release 7.0a, since the posted version
ended up with extra leading periods on the troff commands in the man page.

Releases 8.0 and 9.0 were made available only via the freefriends.org
site.

The ChangeLog was reconstituted based on release dates and diffs. It's
a best effort, but I think it's pretty close to what actually happened.

Future work will be available via github.
